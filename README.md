# AI Mock Interviewer

Simulate realistic technical and behavioral interviews powered by AI.

## 🧠 Overview

The AI Mock Interviewer is a web app that helps users prepare for real-world software engineering interviews by simulating dynamic mock interviews using large language models. It can ask both behavioral and technical questions and provide structured feedback — just like a real Big Tech interviewer.

This project is designed to be a fast, minimal MVP focused on functionality over complexity.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling:** Mantine UI + CSS Modules
- **LLM Integration:** Undetermined (OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.)
- **Backend:** Undetermined

## 🧰 Features

- Simulated behavioral and technical interview questions
- Interactive chat-style UI
- Real-time feedback after each response
- No login required — instant access
- Extensible architecture for future features (voice, analytics, auth)
